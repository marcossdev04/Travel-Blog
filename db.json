      "resume": "Heartbroken, I traveled to Bhutan seeking healing. Amid ancient Buddhist traditions, majestic peaks, and remote villages, I shed layers of pain. Bhutan's spiritual energy and simplicity reignited my essence. Travel's power",
      "content": "I arrived in the Buddhist kingdom of Bhutan feeling like a hollowed-out shell of my former self. Just weeks before, my world had been shattered by heartbreak - a relationship I thought would last forever ending without warning. I was emotionally battered, my sense of self-worth in tatters. In desperation, I booked a solo trip to this remote Himalayan nation, longing to get away and find space for healing. Those first few days were a blur as I numbly wandered the ancient dzong fortresses and fluttering prayer flags, trying to escape the incessant negative thoughts swirling in my mind. Why wasn't I good enough? What was wrong with me? How could I have been so naive? My body was physically present, but my mind and heart were still trapped in cycles of self-doubt and sorrow.",
